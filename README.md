# certmonger-nix

[Certmonger](https://pagure.io/certmonger) and [cepces](https://github.com/openSUSE/cepces), packaged for NixOS.

Together, they allow NixOS hosts to enroll and renew certificates provided by Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS).

Currently, installation works and some configuration options are configurable in the module.
